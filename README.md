The project follows a layered architecture, including controller, service, and data access layers(SongRepository as HashMap<Integer, Object>).

Technologies used in the project include:

-Java 17
-Lombok
-Spring Boot: A Java framework for creating web applications.
-Maven: Dependency management and project build tool.
-Spring Web: A Spring Boot starter for building web applications.
-Springdoc OpenAPI: A starter for generating API documentation based on OpenAPI (formerly Swagger).
-Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf: A Thymeleaf starter for creating HTML views.

The "songify" project provides HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH for performing operations on songs.
It serves as a simple Spring Boot project that can be used as a starting point for building more advanced web applications.
Additionally, with Springdoc OpenAPI, the project automatically generates API documentation, making it easier to use and understand its available features.
